Update June 11, 2023: There's been a lack of updates to this script ever since I released it and unfortunately it will remain that way. The reasons being that I don't have much of an interest in Escargot or WLM in general anymore and from what I've heard the project (Escargot) is now going in directions that I don't agree with, and also the spaghetti code that I wrote is basically unreadable and rewriting it would be the only option which I don't want to do. I'm sorry for the inconvinence.

BEFORE USING PLEASE INSTALL CURL AND UNZIP!!!!
